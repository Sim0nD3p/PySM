# PySM
##To do:
- add way to select multiple items and modify their prop in batch

  - continue work on import
    - confirmationWidget, add props vs add part (merge, remplacer)
    - standard import for parts and props
    - import for orders dates and qte

## where I am:
- create racking object when drawing rectangle and set prop racking_card to enter informations about racking drawn
- mouseRelease in storeViewer should act in storeOverview.

## Mid term
- nomenclature naming module


## Thing to eventually do
- add global code path variable in setting for part/code
- reload partModel in treePropertiesEditor when saved
  - properties path stays when switching part->props after saving

# STORE V2
fomr the start, divided in 2 parts, visual and backend
- VISUAL:
  - store top view
  - move things
## Store generation
- draw/view store in 2d map, (coordinate system)
  - view racking top view
  - view racking content (shelves) when click on racking
  - 

## STORE ALGO V2
- chose how parts are placed
